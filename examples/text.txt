The existing two-stage approval seems to have solved a lot of customisation requests.

But I still get a few from people with this type of request: ‘I want my Finance Director to give second approval on all requests over £5000 but otherwise I just need single approval’.

One possible implementation might be on the ‘Two stage approval’ settings page to just add a cost threshold there. But I welcome your suggestions and input on this idea.
